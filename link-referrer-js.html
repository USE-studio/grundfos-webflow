  Description:
  This script makes sure that if we are on the landingpage 2 
  experience that the home link in the HeaderStd bar leads back to the right origin
-->
<script>
  // For links that need to point to a different location
  // Get the home link in the HeaderStd
  let homeLinks = document.getElementsByClassName('i-am-faithful-home-link')
  // Get document referrer
  let thePlaceFromWhenceYouCame = document.referrer
  console.log('The place from whence you came')
  console.log(thePlaceFromWhenceYouCame)
  // Check if we came from /start and therefore need to change home link to this
  for (let h = 0; h < homeLinks.length; h++) {
    if (thePlaceFromWhenceYouCame.includes('start')) {
      console.log('it is coming from start')
